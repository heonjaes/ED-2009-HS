# Hopsital ER - PatientFlow Insights and Prediction
## Overview
Hospitals face a common challenge: managing the influx of patients in the emergency room and optimizing their waiting times. This project aims to address this issue by leveraging data to provide valuable insights and predictive capabilities. Our goal is to help hospitals enhance their ability to manage and reduce patient waiting times in the Emergency Department (ED).

Through data analysis and modeling, we seek to:

- Understand patterns in patient arrival and departure times.
- Identify factors that impact waiting hours.
- Develop models to forecast patient waiting times.
